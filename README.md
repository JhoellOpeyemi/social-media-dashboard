## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt a lot about Sass while building out this project. It made the process of making the dark theme easier by just re-assigning new values to the variables.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM) - This helped me to understand the basics of Sass. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
